LoadRunner sample code.

1) LoadRunner_TFSExample
This is real code which was developed for a client in order to load test a reporting
system. The URLs have been sanitized for confidentiality reasons.

2) LoadRunner_MSExample
This is real demo code which was created against the legacy myspace.com platform in
order to demonstrate complex LoadRunner logic. This code did a search request and
could then send "Friend Requests" to anyone matching that criteria.
